Data cleaning &amp; Database creation


# Executive Summary

Using SQL, I undertook a comprehensive data cleansing process that involved cleaning up, organizing, fixing, standardizing, and completing dirty data. I also created a robust database to effectively track the online data analysis course sales. This project ensures that the data is accurate, consistent, and reliable, enabling better decision-making and insights for the organization. By maintaining a high standard of data quality, the organization can now monitor sales performance, identify top-selling products, and understand customer behaviour more effectively.

# Business Problem:

LearnData is an e-learning company focused on selling online data analysis courses. Their main objectives are to:
  -  Begin constructing a technological infrastructure to analyze their data.
  -  Clean the data so it can be effectively consumed by various business departments.

To manage their business, LearnData uses the following tools:

 -   Stripe: An online payment processing platform, similar to PayPal.
 -   WordPress: A content management system (CMS) used to build, modify, and maintain websites.
 -   WooCommerce: A WordPress plugin that converts websites into e-commerce sites, allowing product sales.

# Problem Statement

As LearnData has grown in online course sales, they lack information on their sales indicators. They need to start analyzing key financial metrics to determine which products have the highest sales, the types of customers purchasing their products, and the payments received for each product.

Currently, LearnData does not have any system in place to capture, analyze, and make better decisions. They need a database to view and analyze this information, and in the future, create a dashboard with KPIs to monitor the performance of their online course business.
Methodology

 - Determine the source of the raw data.
 - Review data for quality issues, such as missing values/nulls, duplicates, misspellings, incorrect categorizations.
 - Build a database that tracks the online courses sales.
 - SQL query that extracts, cleans and transforms the data from the source of the raw data to database.
 - Conduct a more detailed funnel analysis in SQL to identify financial metrics, determine which products have the highest sales, analyse the types of customers purchasing these products, and evaluate the payments received for each product.

# Skills:

# Results
As a result of performing data cleansing and creating a database to track online course sales, product and sales stakeholders now have complete visibility into the products funnel. This democratization of data empowers stakeholders to self-serve, and the analytics team now can determine which products have the highest sales, analyse the types of customers purchasing these products, and evaluate the payments received for each product.
